# Multiple Linear Regression - Notes and Implementation

This repository contains detailed notes, explanations, and code for understanding and implementing **Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)** using both gradient descent and the normal equation approach.

## Overview

Multiple Linear Regression is a fundamental supervised machine learning technique used to model the relationship between one continuous dependent variable and multiple independent variables (features). This notebook and corresponding Python script demonstrate core concepts, practical implementations, and best practices in performing MLR on a dataset.

## Contents and Learning Highlights

### 1. Data Preparation and Understanding

- The training dataset consists of multiple features representing house attributes such as size (in sqft), number of bedrooms, age of the house, and others.
- The target variable is typically the house price.
- Emphasis on understanding issues arising from features with different scales and units.

### 2. Feature Scaling

- Importance of scaling features for gradient descent efficiency is highlighted.
- Two main methods discussed:
  - **Min-Max Normalization**: Scales features between 0 and 1.
  - **Standardization (Z-score normalization)**: Centers features around zero mean and unit variance.
- Standardization is preferred in this implementation to speed up convergence and improve numerical stability.

### 3. Key Functions for MLR

- **Cost Function (Mean Squared Error)**: Measures how well the model fits training data.
- **Gradient Computation**: Calculates gradients for updating weights and bias in gradient descent.
- **Prediction Function**: Generates predicted outputs based on current weights and inputs.

### 4. Gradient Descent Algorithm

- Implementation of gradient descent for simultaneous update of all feature weights and bias.
- Learning rate and number of iterations are tunable parameters.
- Includes verbose progress and cost history to monitor convergence.
- Visualization of cost decline over iterations and fit of model predictions compared to actual data.

### 5. Normal Equation

- Closed-form solution to calculate optimal weights without iteration.
- Uses the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse for numerical stability.
- Serves as a benchmark to validate gradient descent results.

### 6. Feature Engineering

- Enhances model performance by:
  - Creating new features such as polynomial terms or interaction terms between existing features.
  - Handling categorical variables through one-hot encoding.
  - Removing irrelevant or redundant features.
- Ensures data is clean, well-structured, and suitable for regression.

### 7. Practical Insights

- Comparison between gradient descent and normal equation methods, with pros and cons.
- Common pitfalls like scaling mismatches, forgetting bias term, or matrix inversion errors are addressed.
- Emphasis on consistent data preprocessing across methods.

## Final Summary

This notebook and script collectively provide a robust learning resource for multiple linear regression, covering theoretical foundations, coding from scratch, and practical considerations such as feature scaling and engineering.

Both gradient descent and normal equation approaches are implemented to give a comprehensive understanding of optimization in MLR. Visualization and cost tracking further aid interpretation and debugging of models.

This resource is ideal for students and practitioners aiming to deepen their understanding of linear models and basic machine learning workflow.
