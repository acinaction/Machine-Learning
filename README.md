# 🤖 Machine Learning Journey

This repository is a collection of all my work and learnings as I go through my **Machine Learning journey** — building, understanding, and experimenting with different ML algorithms and concepts.

---

## 🎯 Aim

My goal is to:
- Build a **strong understanding** of core ML concepts  
- Implement algorithms from scratch and using libraries like `scikit-learn`  
- Work on **hands-on projects** after completing each topic  

---

## 🧩 What This Repo Will Contain

- Fundamental algorithms (like Linear & Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.)  
- Notes and code experiments from courses
- Small ML projects and visualizations  
- Anything interesting I explore while learning  

---

## 📚 Current Progress

- ✅ Linear Regression (Multiple Feature), feature engineering and normal equation — implemented and understood  
- 🔄 Working on deeper concepts and multi-feature regression  
- 📈 Planning to explore more ML algorithms step by step
